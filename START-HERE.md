# 🚀 START HERE - NMDR Docker Image Setup

## Welcome!

You have successfully received all the files needed to create and publish your NMDR (National Malaria Data Repository) DHIS2 Docker image.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: First Step

**Before you do anything else, you MUST replace the `malaria-metadata.json` file with your actual malaria metadata JSON file.**

The current file is just a placeholder. Your Docker image will not work properly without your real metadata file.

## Quick Action Plan

### Step 1: Replace Metadata File (REQUIRED)

```bash
# Delete the placeholder file
rm malaria-metadata.json

# Copy your actual metadata file and rename it
cp /path/to/your-metadata-file.json malaria-metadata.json
```

**Critical**: The file MUST be named exactly `malaria-metadata.json`

📖 **Need help?** Read `METADATA-INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

```bash
# Make sure Docker is running
docker --version

# Build the NMDR image
docker-compose build
```

This will take 5-10 minutes as it downloads DHIS2 and sets up everything.

### Step 3: Test Locally

```bash
# Start the services
docker-compose up -d

# Watch the logs to see progress
docker-compose logs -f nmdr
```

**Wait for**: `✨ NMDR Setup Complete!` message (takes 5-10 minutes)

**Then access**: http://localhost:8080
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `district`

### Step 4: Publish to Docker Hub

Once you've tested and verified it works:

```bash
# Tag with your Docker Hub username
docker tag nmdr:latest yourusername/nmdr:latest

# Login to Docker Hub
docker login

# Push the image
docker push yourusername/nmdr:latest
```

### Step 5: Make It Public

1. Go to https://hub.docker.com
2. Find your repository: `yourusername/nmdr`
3. Click **Settings**
4. Change **Visibility** to **Public**
5. Click **Save**

## ✅ Checklist

Before building, make sure:

- [ ] Docker is installed and running
- [ ] You've replaced `malaria-metadata.json` with your actual file
- [ ] Your metadata JSON file is valid
- [ ] You have 10GB free disk space
- [ ] Port 8080 is available (or you've changed it)

## 🎯 Your Goal

By the end of this setup, you will have:

1. ✅ A Docker image named `nmdr:latest` or `yourusername/nmdr:latest`
2. ✅ The image published publicly on Docker Hub
3. ✅ Anyone can pull and run your NMDR instance with one command
4. ✅ Every instance includes all your malaria metadata pre-configured

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test thoroughly** before publishing
2. **Tag with version numbers**: `yourusername/nmdr:v1.0`
3. **Write good documentation** on Docker Hub
4. **Change default passwords** in production
5. **Keep your metadata updated** and rebuild as needed

## 📊 What Users Will Get

When someone uses your image:

```bash
docker pull yourusername/nmdr:latest
docker-compose up -d
```

They will get:
- ✅ Complete DHIS2 2.40.6 instance
- ✅ All your malaria metadata pre-loaded
- ✅ Ready to enter data immediately
- ✅ Working dashboards and reports
- ✅ No configuration needed

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Forgetting to replace malaria-metadata.json
2. ❌ Using wrong file name (must be exactly `malaria-metadata.json`)
3. ❌ Not testing before publishing
4. ❌ Forgetting to make repository public on Docker Hub
5. ❌ Not documenting what's in your image

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Now that you understand what to do:

1. **Read this document** ✅ (you're doing it now!)
2. **Replace the metadata file** → `METADATA-INSTRUCTIONS.md`
3. **Build and test** → `QUICKSTART.md`
4. **Publish** → Instructions above
5. **Share** → Tell others about your NMDR image!

## Next: Replace Your Metadata File

👉 **Go to `METADATA-INSTRUCTIONS.md` now** to learn how to replace the placeholder metadata file with your actual malaria metadata.

Or, if you already have your file ready:

```bash
# Replace the placeholder
rm malaria-metadata.json
cp /path/to/your-actual-metadata.json malaria-metadata.json

# Build
docker-compose build

# Test
docker-compose up -d
```

**Good luck! 🚀**
